# Overload
---
## Description 

### Overload is a 2D platformer where you race to elimnate robotic samurais as quick as possible!  Using a special grappling like game mechanic called G.L.I.T.C.H you can traveling through walls and straight to your enemies with the right amount of skill!  This game was created during a 24 hour hackathon and was the first place that I, with the assistance of my team, really decided to push the limits of what I knew.  This under pressure environment helped me realize that my design patterns were not as good as they could be and really helped push me into deciding to break my design patterns for my games in the future.  After a long 24 hours my team and I won the 'Best Game' award and are super happy with what we've created!

## Notes
- Overload was created at RIT's Computer Science House Hackathon where I worked on a team of 3, including myself.
  - Teammates:
    - Madison Miller, majors in Human Centered Computing at RIT
      - Main role was marketing our game and developing the website and presentation side.
    - Kathryn Eckhart, majors in Software Engineering at RIT
      - Main role was designing levels and assisting developement.
- Overload won 'Best Game' at this hackathon.
- My role in this game was lead engineer and gameplay engineer.
  - I pushed myself during the development of this game to not use my normal patterns for player movement and use mostly vector mathematics like what would be used in industry!
    - This greatly improved my understanding of how vector math works in games.
  - Almost everything programmatically within the game had its code architected by me
